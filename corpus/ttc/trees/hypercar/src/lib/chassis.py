"""Chassis: carbon monocoque tub, front/rear subframes, crash structures.

Architecture
------------
The whole module is organised around ONE line.  A single lower spine runs
unbroken from the front crash flange, forward-to-aft along a machined box
longeron, straight into the tub's **chine** crease, out again into the rear box
longeron and dies on the rear crash flange.  Front to rear, at one height, one
continuous edge -- that is the thing the eye is meant to follow, and everything
else is subordinate to it.

The tub is a real *bathtub*: one lofted solid whose closed section runs from the
centre of the underfloor, out through the tuck-under, up the rocker flank, over
the sill crown and back down to the cockpit floor.  It is built from FOUR spline
bands, so the section carries three deliberate lines instead of one soft bulge:

``chine``     where the undercut tuck stops and the rocker flank begins.  A ~50
              degree tangent break: a genuine crease, not a large radius.  It is
              also the tub's share of the full-length spine, so its Y and Z at
              the tub end faces are exactly where the box longerons start.
``waist``     the max-width line, low on the flank.  A ~25 degree break that
              splits the flank into a rising lower plane and a tumbling-in upper
              plane, which is what puts tension in it.
``crown``     a tight 13 mm roll over the top of the sill.  Tangent-continuous
              into the flank, so it reads as a narrow bright band, not an edge.

Everything else on the section is G1, so the moulded-carbon read comes for free.

Two things fought back and are worth knowing before editing:

* ThruSections will not close this section family if a band split lands on the
  outboard edge of a raised cockpit lip, and a lip that tight ripples along X
  anyway -- the sill crown came out visibly quilted.  The opening is edged with
  a bonded rail instead, which is crisper and is how a real tub is finished.
* A varying skin inset on the end plugs barrels their surface over an 80 mm span
  and wrinkles it.  They keep a constant 3 mm inset and live entirely inside the
  tub skin; the *walls* carry the shaping instead.

The bulkhead (X~+780) and firewall (X~-780) each pair such a plug with a lofted
wall.  The firewall's top edge IS the roll hoop; the engine-bay aperture is cut
under it and it is braced by two back-stays into the rear subframe.

Subframes are NOT tube spaceframes.  The four main members are lofted box
longerons with small corner radii, because a swept circle cannot hold a line:
a box longeron carries four continuous highlight edges down its length and picks
the tub's creases up where they stop.  Round tubes are kept for the diagonal
bracing only, so the soft members read as subordinate to the sharp ones.  Nodes
are machined billets, not spheres, for the same reason.  Crash structures are
tapered carbon boxes on machined flanges -- four hard edges converging on the
tip, aimed straight down the car.
