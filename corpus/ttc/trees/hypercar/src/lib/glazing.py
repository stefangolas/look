"""Glazing: the DLO glass and the lamp lenses.

Everything here is cut from a master surface, never modelled standalone:

  * windscreen / side glass / rear screen are the canopy shell intersected
    with the DLO openings, so the glass is exactly flush with the pillars and
    the tumblehome is inherited from the canopy section;
  * the lamp lenses are the BODY shell intersected with a lens region, so the
    reflection line runs off the fender and straight across the lamp with no
    step -- the thing that usually gives a CAD car away.
