"""Material palette for the hypercar.

IMPORTANT -- colour space.  The render pipeline treats build123d ``Color``
channels as **linear** RGB and converts them to sRGB for display
(``packages/cadgen-js/src/lib/assembly/meshData.js`` ``linearChannelToSrgbByte``).
So ``Color(0.5, 0.5, 0.5)`` shows up as roughly ``#BCBCBC``, not ``#808080``.

Every colour here is therefore authored as the sRGB hex you actually want to
see and converted with :func:`srgb`.  Never hand-write raw float triples.

Also: a colour set on a *group* compound is ignored by the render package --
only leaf occurrences carry colour.  Use :func:`style` on every leaf.
