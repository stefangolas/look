"""Lighting -- the car's face.

The signature is ONE gesture per corner: a slim light-guide blade that runs
aft along the prow just under the fender crest, then turns hard down over the
crown of the front fender and dives into the corner intake.  Head-on the two
blades read as a pair of wide brackets framing the nose; in three-quarter view
the down-stroke is the event.

**A lamp graphic is only ever as good as the form it is cut into.**  A light
line drawn on an undifferentiated dome floats, because there is nothing for it
to be *parallel to* and nothing for it to *terminate into*.  So this module
also carries the three hard lines that give the prow its structure, and it
owns them because every one of them starts at the lamp:

``crown_crease``  sits exactly on the master surface's fender crest and runs
                  from the prow tip aft to the front-fascia shutline.  The
                  crest is already a ~90 deg corner in the master section; the
                  crease closes it to ~46 deg, which turns a soft outline into
                  a fender crown, and gives the DRL blade a line to run
                  beneath.  Two parallel lines read as structure; one line
                  alone reads as a decal.

``hood_crease``   the one that actually breaks the dome.  The crest is the
                  silhouette in every three-quarter view, so sharpening it
                  leaves the 700 mm of upper surface inboard of it untouched
                  -- and that expanse was the bloat.  This line branches off
                  the crown crease at the prow, diverges aft across the top
                  surface, and lands on (BX_FASCIA_F, BY_HOOD), the exact
                  corner where the hood|fender shutline starts, so the line
                  the eye is following becomes the panel gap and carries on
                  down the car.  Between the two creases the fender crown is a
                  defined wedge; inboard of them the hood valley is a defined
                  panel.

``cheek_crease``  picks up where the blade's down-stroke stops -- previously it
                  faded into nothing, which the brief forbids -- and carries it
                  aft and down into the leading edge of the front wheel arch.
                  That is the transition from the fender volume into the
                  corner intake.

All three are body-coloured and grown off the master surface, so they read as
the form tightening rather than as trim laid on top of it.

Everything else is subordinate.  The lamp aperture is a slim almond slung
directly under the blade holding four machined projector jewels with bronze
retaining rings.  The tail echoes the front exactly: one continuous blade
across the full width whose ends turn down and hook around the rear corners,
with a comb of fine vertical light guides recessed beneath it.

Construction notes
------------------
* The blades are lofted through frames built on the master surface, so they
  hug the body instead of floating on a plane.
* The creases are lofted through frames built on the crest *corner* of the
  master section, with the ridge normal taken as the bisector of the two
  surface normals meeting there, so a crease is a real sharpening of the
  master form rather than a strip laid on top of it.
* The lamp apertures are lofted through *section* profiles offset inside their
  own YZ plane, with the offset scaled by 1/(m.n) so the result is a true
  normal offset of the master surface.
* Nothing is filleted after a boolean.

# Two things decide whether that reads as a crease or as a rod lying on the
# panel, and both had to be found the hard way:
#
#   * POWER.  _slat's superellipse is |x/a|^p + |y/b|^p = 1, so near the apex
#     x ~= a - a(|y|/b)^p and dx/dy -> 0 for any p > 1: every p above 1 gives a
#     FLAT top, not a ridge.  Only p = 1 -- a true diamond -- puts a corner
#     there.  (The periodic spline through the sampled points still relieves it
#     to a few millimetres of radius, which is what a real crease has.)
#   * ASPECT.  Proudness must be small against width or the section reads as a
#     tube.  At 11 proud x 42 wide it looked like a rod laid on the hood; at
#     9 proud x 86 wide the flanks fall at ~16 deg and it reads as the surface
#     itself breaking.
