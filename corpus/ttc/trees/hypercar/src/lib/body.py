"""Body panels, cut out of the one master shell.

No panel here is modelled on its own.  Each is ``body_skin() & region``, and
the regions are separated by ``SHUT_GAP``, so:

  * neighbouring panels are literally the same surface -- highlight and
    reflection lines cross every break with no kink, by construction;
  * every shutline is a real constant-width gap, not a drawn line;
  * the panels tile the car exactly, so nothing floats or overlaps.

The greenhouse is handled the same way: the canopy shell is split into the DLO
glass openings (owned by ``glazing``) and the pillar/roof structure (here), so
the A-pillar, roof rail and C-pillar are exactly ``DLO_PILLAR`` wide.
