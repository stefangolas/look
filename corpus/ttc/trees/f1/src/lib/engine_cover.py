"""Engine cover panel, airbox intake, cooling louvres, aerial fin.

Two REMOVABLE PANELS. Both are genuine shells — an outer loft minus an inner
loft — so every free edge shows carbon thickness and the strip-down animation
can lift them off an engine that is really there underneath.

THE SECTION LAW (engine cover)
------------------------------
Every station is one closed outline built from four named features, written as
a front-view sketch in (y, z) from the centreline bottom, out, and over the
top:

    SILL    (y_cr - uc, z_cr - drop)  the panel's free lower edge, TUCKED IN
    CREASE  (y_cr, z_cr)              THE feature line: widest point, KNUCKLE
    RIDGE   (0,    spine_z + h_r)     centreline crest — a V, not a dome

    RIDGE --deck + spine--> CREASE --skirt--> SILL --(false bottom, cut away)

Both named lines are genuine CORNERS, not highlights, and they are built the
only way a lofted spline section can hold a corner: points 2.4-2.6 mm apart
straddling the vertex, with the tangent on each side taken from the analytic
law of the surface that meets there. The spline is then forced to turn through
the whole included angle inside 5 mm, which at render resolution is an edge.

  * at the CREASE the deck arrives falling at 57-67 deg and the skirt leaves
    at 105-121 deg — the outline turns a hard 52-69 deg corner, and because
    the skirt tucks INBOARD (`_undercut`) the crease is unambiguously the
    widest point of the section with daylight under it;
  * at the RIDGE two tensioned deck surfaces meet on the centreline at about
    110 deg. The spine is zero where the airbox owns the centreline, rises as
    the aperture closes, and the aerial fin then grows straight out of its
    crest — so it starts and ends on another feature, never fading out.

Everything between the two corners is ONE function (`surf_z`): a deck of
`1 - (1 - u)^2` — flat under the spine, turning down hard only in the last
third before the crease — with the spine's `h (1 - v)^2` added on top of it.
Adding rather than butting the two laws together is what keeps the valley at
the foot of the spine tangent-continuous; see `_ridge_z`.

THE COKE-BOTTLE WAIST
---------------------
`crease()` is the plan-view story. Ahead of x = -2860 the sidepod panel owns
`spec.SHOULDER_LINE` (its crease sits at y = 500 at the crest, far outboard of
this panel), so the cover carries its own crease just inboard of the sidepod's
inner wall — a second line, parallel, one panel break away. At x = -2860 the
sidepod is gone and the two lines merge: from there aft the cover's crease IS
`spec.shoulder_at(x)` exactly, pinching 319 -> 176 -> 155 mm and terminating
into the rear-wing pylon root run at (-3800, 62, 386). Half width falls by 58%
between the cockpit and the tail; that is the waist.

THE SPINE
---------
One analytic fall, 852 at the roll hoop to 434 over the gearbox, with the rate
growing rearward (0.45t + 0.55t^3). No table, no keyframes, so there is no
bump and no flat spot anywhere along 1750 mm. It clears the plenum crown
(z = 699 at x = -2235..-2570) by 30 mm and the gearbox casing by 23 mm.

WHAT IS CUT INTO IT
-------------------
* the airbox aperture — the airbox's own outer loft, grown by `spec.PANEL_GAP`,
  subtracted from the cover, so the two panels meet at a real joint, and a
  3.2 mm proud exposed-weave flange (`_aperture_flange`) rings the hole so the
  break is a STEP with a lit edge rather than a smooth continuation;
* six gill louvres per flank, chord and pitch on `spec.CHORD_RATIO` /
  `spec.GAP_RATIO`, each with a slot cut through into the cavity behind it;
* the hot-air exit at the gearbox: the cavity runs out of the back, and a
  rolled bead (radius `spec.TIP_ROLL_R`) wraps the aperture edge.
