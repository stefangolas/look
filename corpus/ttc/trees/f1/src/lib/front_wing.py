"""Front wing: mainplane + four flaps, endplates, cascades, mounting pillars.

The whole part is one idea: a five-element cascade whose chord, slot gap and
incidence all step through the geometric progressions in `spec`, wrapped by a
sculpted endplate that curls outboard at the bottom and rolls over at the top.

Two rules make the cascade READ rather than merely exist:

  * every slot gap is TRUE DAYLIGHT. `spec.cascade_gaps` is measured from the
    element's own upper surface at the overlap station, not from its chord
    line, so a stated 24 mm gap is 24 mm of visible air and not 24 mm minus
    whatever the section happened to be doing there.
  * the cascade OPENS OUTBOARD. One law (`_open`) drives both the slot scale
    and the chordwise step, so the stack is tight and neutral where the nose
    needs the air undisturbed and steps up in clear layers everywhere the eye
    actually looks. The flaps are cut off inboard on a rhythmic progression,
    which is what lets you count five elements from the front.

Spanwise the wing is a SPOON: near-flat through the neutral central section
(mainplane only, |y| < 150), washing in to full incidence over |y| = 160..730,
then rolling down hard into the endplate so the topmost flap's tip trailing
edge dies exactly on the endplate's rear diagonal instead of poking out of it.

# `twist_deg` silently yawed the section instead of pitching it (build123d's
# `Plane.rotated()` composes in WORLD axes), so incidence was routed through
# `sweep_deg` as a workaround. `surfaces.section_plane()` has since been rebuilt
# from explicit direction vectors and `twist_deg` now does what it says, so
# the workaround is gone and the station dicts carry plain `twist`.
