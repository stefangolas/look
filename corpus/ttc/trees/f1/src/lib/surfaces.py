         cutter escaped its sections by ~200 mm, gouged through to the rim, and

    Case 2 passes `is_valid`, passes watertightness, passes a positive-volume
    check, and passes `inspect refs`. Only comparing the result against its own
    input sections catches it, which is what `loft_escaped` does.

    A THIRD mode, and the reason for the segment fallback below: OCC's

    spine stripe is the worked example — 29 twisting periodic sections, and the

    smooth and the ruled whole-stack attempts die. Lofting each adjacent pair
