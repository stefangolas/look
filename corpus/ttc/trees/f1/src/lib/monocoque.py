"""Survival cell, cockpit surround, halo — the car's central volume.

The geometry lives in two siblings so neither file is unreadable:

  * `mono_tub`  — the lofted carbon tub, its cockpit trough and rolled rim,
                  the roll-hoop blade and stays, the headrest shoulders and
                  the inboard suspension pickup fairings.
  * `mono_halo` — the titanium halo: central blade pillar, the continuous
                  side loop, and the three machined mounts.

Everything is built directly in car coordinates (spec's frame), so the
assembly is a flat list of correctly-placed children.
