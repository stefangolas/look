"""Corners: slick tyres, rims, aero wheel covers, wheel nuts, carbon brake
discs, six-pot calipers, brake ducts, uprights and hubs.

Everything is modelled in a LOCAL WHEEL FRAME whose origin is the axle centre
and whose axes are parallel to the car's: +X forward, +Y outboard, +Z up. One
`Pos()` at the end drops the corner onto its car-coordinate hub, so a corner
stays a single rigid child that the steering animation can rotate about the
front ball-joint axis — upright, hub, brake, duct and wheel all turn together
because they are one child, and the wishbones do not, because their outboard
ends sit exactly on that axis.

The LEFT corner is modelled and the right corner is its y-mirror, which is
what guarantees a ball-joint eye lands exactly on the mirrored hardpoint.
Every eye centre in here is `spec`'s hardpoint minus the hub origin — no
number in this file re-states a suspension coordinate.
