"""Detail furniture — the jewellery that makes the render read as a real car.

THE RULE THIS MODULE NOW OBEYS
------------------------------
Nothing here is bolted onto the car at a right angle, and nothing here floats.
Every item either grows out of a surface whose position was measured off the
module that owns it, or it is not in the model at all. Concretely:

  * MIRRORS — the one item that has to be beautiful. The housing is a real
    teardrop: a round leading edge whose half-width and half-height follow a
    single elliptic growth law to a blunt maximum at the glass, then roll over
    a quarter-ellipse rim. The section is a per-quadrant superellipse, rounder
    outboard than inboard, so the outer edge is genuinely rolled. The stalk is
    NOT a stick meeting a wall: it is a blade stack with a per-station chord
    AND per-station thickness, so it keeps a near-constant chord while its t/c
    doubles at each end — a fillet where it leaves the tub flank, a collar
    where it enters the housing — and wastes to a slim aerofoil in between.
    Housing and stalk are FUSED into one body: there is no joint to hide.
  * SIDE CAMERAS — same construction, one third the size, rooted in the
    cockpit-surround deck flank at x = -1220 (measured: the tub flank is
    y = 385 there, near vertical). They used to sit at y = 150, z = 830, which
    is inside the engine cover and above nothing; that pod is gone.
  * TYRE IR SENSORS — one faired bracket per corner, its root buried in the
    brake-duct drum wall and spread into a fairing, its head swelling into the
    sensor body.
  * PITOT MAST — was a four-tube rake. Now ONE probe on one faired blade mast:
    the critic read the rake as a row of loose fittings, and restraint beats
    quantity.
  * DZUS — one row, five a side, on the floor's outboard mounting line, each
    sunk in a machined recess so only a dish and a flush head show. The engine
    cover row is deleted: it rode `spec.shoulder_at`, which by x = -2400 is
    38 mm OUTBOARD of the cover's own crease, so those heads hung in air — and
    `engine_cover.py` already carries the fasteners for its own panel.
  * TOW EYES AND JACK POINTS — verified against their hosts (nose crease at
    x = 1150 is y = 123.4/z = 232.4; the rear crash structure at x = -3930 is
    hw = 57.6, z = 345..396). The rear jack moved 26 mm forward to clear the
    beam wing leading edge at x = -3960.
  * GPS PUCK — deleted. It sat at (-2400, 0, 505); the engine cover's crown at
    that station is z = 762, so the puck was 257 mm inside the bodywork.

Numbers taken off neighbouring modules are stated as datums below with the
station they were measured at, so a hand-off change is a one-line edit.
