"""Survival cell: the sculpted carbon tub, its cockpit trough, roll structure.

THE SECTION LAW
---------------
Every station is one closed outline, written outboard as a front-view sketch
in (y, z) and read from the centreline keel up and over to the centreline
spine.  Five named features, blended from the keyframe table below:

    KEEL   centreline bottom, `zb`            the tub's own floor
    CHINE  bottom corner, radius `rc`         where the belly turns vertical
    CREASE `spec.shoulder_at(x)` -> (hw, zc)  THE feature line
    SHOULDER top corner, radius `rs`          the deck's outer knuckle
    SPINE  centreline top, `zt` + `crown`

THE CREASE IS A CORNER, NOT A BLEND
-----------------------------------
An earlier tub rolled through the crease at a 143 deg included angle — a soft
knuckle that lit as one continuous highlight, so the body read as a
shrink-wrapped pod. The section is now built as TWO CUBICS THAT MEET AT AN
ANGLE, and the outline carries two points 2 * `CREASE_D` apart straddling the
corner so the interpolating spline has to turn inside a 9 mm knuckle instead of
rounding over the neighbouring 60 mm:

    below   the flank leaves the chine VERTICAL and flares outboard, arriving
            at the crease leaning 20 deg (nose) to 57 deg (cockpit) off
            vertical. Its second derivative is outward, so the flank is
            SCOOPED: the crease overhangs a belly that tucks in by up to 112 mm
            and the whole lower surface faces down-and-out, into shadow.
    above   the deck leaves the crease nearly HORIZONTAL (68-89 deg off
            vertical), turns up within ~60 mm and runs to the knuckle as a
            taut, near-vertical cockpit side.

Included angle at the crease is 45-70 deg the whole length of the tub, so one
hard line catches the key light from the bulkhead to the engine face while the
flank under it stays dark. That contrast is the shoulder line; without it the
same volume is a blob.

Every outline is generated ANALYTICALLY with a fixed point count per feature,
never by arc-length re-sampling a polyline. Re-sampling moved each point along
the outline as a piecewise-linear function of x, and those kinks in the loft's
control net came back as a chevron ripple with exactly the station pitch.

The tub is one loft from the nose panel break (x = 700, where the section is
handed over from `nose.py` — half width 194.6, z 157..300, crease at z 266)
to the engine mounting face at `spec.SURVIVAL_CELL_REAR_X`.  Below z = 157 at
the bulkhead the tub fairs its OWN keel: the nose sits on top of a tub that
continues below it.

The cockpit is cut, not modelled hollow: one lofted cavity whose floor rises
at both ends, so the opening's plan outline is where that floor breaches the
deck.  The rolled rim is a genuine swept bead (2 * TIP_ROLL_R tall, rolled at
TIP_ROLL_R) running around the front and both sides and dying into the
headrest shoulders — a feature line that terminates into another body.

#  Station count is a TESSELLATION decision as much as a shape one. The skin is
#  one B-spline face with no interior boundary, so the mesher's rows fall on the
#  surface's own v-knots — one per station. At 22 stations the rows are 128 mm
#  apart and each quad twists enough that its two triangles disagree, which
#  renders as a sawtooth chevron running the whole length of the shoulder. The
#  surface itself was never rippled (its crease line is monotone to <1 mm
#  between stations); only the mesh was. Do not drop this back below ~28: the
#  cost is boolean time against a bigger skin face, and the payoff is a shoulder
#  that stays a line instead of a zigzag.

#  driver, which is 112 mm of undercut in 141 mm of flank height.
#  `th` is the DECK KNUCKLE half-width as a fraction of the crease. It has to
#  stay high enough that the rolled cockpit rim (`cw` + _RIM_W/2) still lands on
#  the flat deck rather than hanging over the knuckle round; the deck's
#  fall-away is set by the crease TANGENT (DECK_KY), not by this number.

# WHY THE CORNER IS 9 MM WIDE AND NOT 3
#
# The crease is carried on ONE periodic spline per station (`half_section_face`)
# and the shape of that corner is right at any width: measured across two
# station intervals the crease line is smooth to 0.12 mm in y. What is NOT free
# is the MESH. The skin is a single 2.7 m B-spline face and the artifact
# pipeline tessellates it at 0.6 rad angular tolerance, so a 1.4 mm corner gets
# about three facets, they disagree from row to row, and the shoulder renders as
# a sawtooth. Widening the corner to `CREASE_D` = 4.5 (a 9 mm knuckle, still a
# quarter of a percent of the section) gives the mesher room while reading as a
# crisp double-edged highlight rather than a rounded-off blend.
#
# Two alternatives were built and measured, and both are worse:
#   * splitting the station into four edges so the crease is a real B-REP edge
#     works and cuts cleanly, but each strip then carries far fewer knots and
#     the whole skin drops to ~1.5 k triangles — every surface goes faceted to
#     fix one line;
#   * `Spline(tangents=...)` to state the corner tangents exactly: build123d
#     normalises tangent magnitude, and the stated tangent blew the left deck
#     out to 1094 mm against its own mirror's 670 mm. That lopsided solid still
#     passed `is_valid_shape` AND the cockpit cut against it silently returned
#     the tub unmodified — the exact silent failure this module warns about.
