"""Sidepod bodywork panels, inlets, undercut, cooling louvres; radiators.

THE SECTION LAW
---------------
Every sidepod station is one closed outline built from five named points and
four cubic arcs between them. Written outboard-to-inboard as a front-view
sketch, in (y, z):

    IWT  inner wall top      the panel's inboard edge, against the tub
    CR   THE CREASE          `spec.shoulder_at(x)` — the car's feature line
    WD   widest point        the flank's maximum half-width
    LP   undercut lip        the sharp lower edge of the flank  (LOWEST point)
    IWB  inner wall bottom    inboard end of the scooped belly

    IWT --gutter--> CR --deck--> WD --flank--> LP --undercut--> IWB --wall--> IWT

CR is a real hard knuckle because the deck leaves it crowned while the gutter
falls away inboard, and it is sampled straight off `spec.shoulder_at()` so the
line is continuous with the monocoque forward and the engine cover aft. Its
HEIGHT also sets the height of the widest point: WD is pinned a few mm under
CR, which is what puts the pod's maximum half-width up at z = 380-400 instead
of halfway down the flank.

THE UNDERCUT is the whole point of the part. Read WD -> LP as a wing section
lying on its side: convex crowned shoulder above the crease, a ~115 deg fold at
WD, then a strongly CONCAVE sweep that leaves the crease running almost
horizontally INBOARD — a genuine overhang — before turning down to the lip.
`_BOW` sets how far that sweep is sucked in past the WD->LP chord (up to 42 mm)
and `_flank_ctrl()` builds the two Bezier handles off the chord normal so the
tuck deepens and shallows with the plan shape instead of being keyframed twice.

The numbers that make it read: between x = -1050 and x = -2400 the lip is
tucked 150-220 mm INBOARD of the widest point and climbs 206 -> 330 mm while
the crease stays out at y = 728-750 and up at z = 357-395. Under a floor that
runs out to y = 900 that overhang is a 200 mm deep slot of daylight, which is
exactly what you are looking at from a low front three-quarter.

The panel is a genuine SHELL: the outer loft minus a cavity loft inset along
the section normal. So the inlet is a real letterbox opening with a carbon lip
all the way round, the duct throat runs inward and rearward, the rear exit is
open, and the louvre slots cut through into the same volume the radiators sit
in. Nothing is faked with a painted-on hole.
