# Autobuild loop — STATE

Rewritten at the end of every session. The **volatile** part — everything from
"Where we are" through "The parallelism picture" — is capped at ~120 lines and
must be rewritten each time. "Traps" and everything below it is **stable and
accumulates**: entries are added when something costs a session and removed only
when they stop being true, never for length. (The old header claimed the cap
covered everything above "Quick reference"; it never did, and pretending
otherwise would eventually cost a trap.) If you are picking this up cold, read
**this file, then
[`loop/ORCHESTRATOR.md`](ORCHESTRATOR.md) for how to run the loop, then
`python loop/slot_status.py`** — nothing else. Do not read `LEDGER.jsonl` whole.

Updated 2026-08-21, close of session 16. Branch: `integration/kernel-bg`. Nothing
from the loop has reached `main` and nothing has been pushed.

## What this is, if you have never seen it

`vendor/truck/` is a vendored CAD kernel this repo owns. A formal specification,
`docs/GENERATION_KERNEL_BUILD_SPEC.md`, lists ~56 numbered contract items
(`BG-S0-*`, `BG-EVD-*`, `BG-TOL-*`, …) that harden it — replacing panics with
refusals carrying evidence, giving tolerances a model, certifying enclosures.
This loop discharges those items with LLM workers instead of by hand.

**You are the orchestrator.** You write work packets, schedule them, adjudicate
verification, and amend the spec. **You do not write the kernel code.** A packet
is dispatched to a worker (deepseek v4 flash via opencode) that gets one file —
the packet — and one git worktree, and gets no say in whether its work is
accepted. `loop/verify.py` is the only acceptance authority; a worker's
`RESULT.json` is a claim, never a verdict.

Three documents define the rest, and you should read them in this order when a
specific need arises rather than upfront:

- [`docs/KERNEL_AUTOBUILD_LOOP.md`](../docs/KERNEL_AUTOBUILD_LOOP.md) — the loop
  design: packet schema (§4), the V-gates (§5), context budget (§3), disk (§7).
- [`docs/GENERATION_KERNEL_BUILD_SPEC.md`](../docs/GENERATION_KERNEL_BUILD_SPEC.md)
  — the contract items themselves and **house rules H-1..H-8**, which every
  packet restates and every worker must obey. H-8 is the one that bites: anchors
  are `rg` patterns and symbol names, never line numbers, and a count mismatch
  is a stop condition, not a nuisance.
- `loop/packets/BG-TOL-001-GEOM-NURBS.md` — the newest and largest worked
  example (57 sites, 26 contexts, 12 deferrals, six files), generated from a
  reviewed survey by `gen_packet --skeleton` and landed in one dispatch.
  `BG-TOL-001-MESHALGO.md` is the previous one, `BG-TOL-001-SHAPEOPS.md` the
  older hand-written shard, and `BG-S0-003.md` older still.
- `loop/packets/BG-EVD-004-r2.md` — written, checked and **undispatched**; the
  worked example of a packet that fixes a defect rather than migrating sites.
- `loop/packets/BG-TOL-001-MESHALGO-SURVEY.md` — the `class: survey` template,
  sharpened after its first run. Copy it to survey a new crate.

The loop is a **build** loop, not a search loop: acceptance is mechanical and
deterministic, so the verifier does the job an objective function would. Nothing
here is scored, tuned, or sampled.

## Where we are

**Fifty-seven packets DONE of 70 (81%) — the user's defined breakpoint for
this session, reached and closed cleanly.** Session 16 landed **nine**:

The stage-1 CE pair, both first-try ACCEPTED (fault NONE):
`BG-CE-002` — the whole-span leader-vs-carrier deviation certificate in
`truck-evidence/src/deviation.rs`, TWO routes: the difference spline
(one-shot for exact-spline pairs, including `PCurve<_, Plane>` flattened
exactly; measured bound 2.5e-14 at tau=1e-6, zero subdivisions) and the
budgeted box-diff bisection fallback. The packet also fixed a real defect
the pre-dispatch scratch run found in the landed carriers:
`knot_multiplicity` (3 copies) counted neighbouring distinct knots by
tolerance, so sub-curve extraction stopped converging within 1e-6 of every
knot (BG-ENC-002 violation, sound but non-convergent; spec amended).

`BG-CE-003` — the construction-DAG identity algebra
(`EntityId/OpId/Op/OpKind/OpParams/Selector/End`) in
`truck-topology/src/entity_id.rs`: standalone, no geometry, serde
round-trip, bit-wise float equality (f64 has neither Eq nor Hash in std),
stable FNV-1a+fmix64 hash pinned by three KAT constants that reproduced
exactly. The `Arc<Mutex>->Arc` migration is the new row
`BG-CE-003-MIGRATE` (SPECD, needs its own design packet for the
replacement API first).

Then the seven-packet INV wave, `BG-INV-101/102/103/104/105/108/109`, one
new module each under `truck-topology/src/invariants/` behind orchestrator
scaffolding (nine `Prop` arms + the module tree, landed up front for
disjoint write sets): coedge pairing, vertex link, Euler–Poincaré,
same-parameter (calling CE-002's certificate; attempt 1 was a SPEC_GAP —
the worker correctly stopped on missing truck-evidence/inari/truck-
geometry manifest deps, amended and re-dispatched), domain-boundary (the
topological core; the pcurve half documented as waiting), the pure
nesting-forest checker with an injectable inside-oracle (the NUM-004 seam;
the and/or `Vec<Solid>` break is deferred with a spec amendment — a
partition without a certified oracle mis-splits nested cavities), and
wedge non-degeneracy (v1 midpoint-sampled, `Method::Float` honestly).

**One flake paid for and recovered:** BG-INV-102's first verify REJECTED
on V8 via `geom_impls::test_circle_arc_tangent0` — a proptest that drew a
near-degenerate case failing deterministically AT BASE too (4/4 with the
seed pinned, replayed at base through the regression DIRECTORY). A latent
property defect (missing precondition on t near 0/1), not a packet
regression; artifact removed, re-verify ACCEPTED, fault NONE with a
fault-note. The property itself needs a truck-modeling test fix packet
some day — outside every current write set.

Nothing in flight at close. GATE-4 at 110/110, untouched all session.

## Pick up here

1. **The frontier is small and mechanical now.** `python loop/schedule.py`
   at close: eligible = `BG-ENC-004-ISC` (mechanical, W5 — CE-002 landed,
   so the residual certificate it waits for EXISTS as
   `certify_deviation`; the der/tangent_cone halves were always composable)
   and `BG-CE-003-MIGRATE` (wide-mechanical — but its note says it needs a
   design packet first: the set_point/mapped replacement API shape is a
   breaking design decision the orchestrator owns). ISC is the natural
   next dispatch; MIGRATE's design packet is the next orchestrator design
   task after that.
2. **The tail after these two** is the FID chain the session-15 close
   recorded: FID-001, NUM-003, TOL-005, EVD-005, NUM-002/004, ISC→…
   NUM-004 also unlocks the INV-108 wiring (the and/or `Vec<Solid>` break
   deferred with the spec amendment) and the certified oracle for the
   nesting forest.
3. **Known deferred work, recorded in the spec:** INV-105's pcurve-domain
   half (waits on pcurve wiring into faces); INV-109's whole-span
   certification (waits on pcurve parameter images feeding `normal_cone`);
   the `test_circle_arc_tangent0` property fix (truck-modeling, missing
   precondition on t near 0/1 — the seed is in this file's traps).
4. **If the machine will sleep, stop the watchdog first** (`loop/watchdog.lock`
   holds its pid; it is STOPPED at close, STOP line in its log). Restart
   with `LOOK_WATCHDOG_STAGNANT=3600` via the `cmd /c` incantation when
   dispatch resumes.
5. Disk was 20.2 GB at close — check `Get-PSDrive C` before the first
   verify of the next session (each V8 baseline builds a throwaway
   workspace; three slot targets sit at ~7 GB each and
   `slot_status.py --disk` reports both target locations).

## State of the machine, as left

- **Watchdog STOPPED at close** (process killed after its last HEARTBEAT
  poll 325; the STOP line is appended to `watchdog.log`). Nothing was in
  flight. Restart with `LOOK_WATCHDOG_STAGNANT=3600` via the `cmd /c`
  incantation; stop before any machine sleep.
- **All three slots IDLE on their landed branches** (slot 0 `2252117`
  BG-INV-104, slot 1 `d22d9f7` BG-INV-108, slot 2 `c995935` BG-INV-109);
  `new_slot.py` re-forks them for the next dispatch.
- **Disk 20.2 GB at close.** The session's verifies and nine landings ran
  comfortably; the three slot targets hold ~7/6/7 GB. Check
  `Get-PSDrive C` before verify runs; `slot_status.py --disk` reports both
  target locations per slot.
- Registry: **57 DONE / 11 SPECD / 2 BLOCKED** (70 rows — one MORE than
  session 15: `BG-CE-003-MIGRATE` was added at CE-003's re-scope).
  Registry edits are python-only (the BOM trap).
- GATE-4 ceiling **110/110**, never moved all session (every packet's
  tests avoided `unscaled_legacy(` — the CE-002 worker's
  `ToleranceCtx::new` adaptation set the pattern the INV-104 packet
  mandated).
- `loop/packets/` gained nine packets this session (BG-CE-002, BG-CE-003,
  BG-INV-101/102/103/104/105/108/109); `loop/results/` holds their filed
  RESULT.jsons; the ledger is at 52 rows.

## The parallelism picture

70 rows. Nothing in flight; the CE chain's stage 1 AND the INV wave are
fully landed. What remains by class: 10 mechanical, 9 design, 1
wide-mechanical... (re-run `python loop/schedule.py` for the live counts —
at close: eligible `BG-ENC-004-ISC` + `BG-CE-003-MIGRATE`, everything else
gated on the FID/NUM chain or BLOCKED). The INV-106/107 rows wait on
FID-001/TOL-001-TYPE; SHARED-CONE on PCURVE+ISC; OFFSET BLOCKED on the
EnclosureSurface interface question. The next orchestrator design work,
in order: the ISC packet (mostly composition — read
`decorators/intersection_curve.rs`'s scaffold, it records the shape), the
MIGRATE replacement-API design, then the FID chain.

Session 16's cost picture: nine packets landed for two SPEC_GAPs paid
(zero redispatches beyond the amended 104), one flake appeased (INV-102,
fault NONE with fault-note), one first-attempt dispatch refusal
(`run_packet.py`'s own anchor check caught a broken `grep -rc` anchor
before any worker was paid), and nine first-try verifies ACCEPTED out of
ten (the one rejection was the flake). The pre-dispatch scratch-crate
validation caught three design errors before dispatch (f64 lacks Eq/Hash;
Hasher's unstable float methods; the carrier convergence defect) and the
workers caught five packet errors the scratch could not see (the
in-crate-vs-out-of-crate class) — the division of labor worked exactly as
designed.

## Traps, each one paid for
- **The watchdog's default 1200s wedged-killer kills healthy workers during a
  model-latency storm.** Session 13's endpoint had 23-60+ minute silence gaps
  from boot on three workers; the shipped default killed two of them mid-think
  (both later passed verify after redispatch — the kills cost ~25 min each).
  Start it with `LOOK_WATCHDOG_STAGNANT=3600`, and note **PowerShell 5.1's
  `Start-Process` has no `-Environment` parameter** — launch through
  `cmd /c "set LOOK_WATCHDOG_STAGNANT=3600&& python loop/watchdog.py"` or the
  variable silently never reaches the child.
- **The watchdog reaps on its own events-growth clock, not yours.** PARCYL's
  first worker looked 67 minutes stale from outside, but the run_packet boot
  touches the events file again after the worker's first write, so the
  watchdog's 3600s clock started ~13 minutes later than the file mtime
  suggested — and the reap fired at exactly `stagnant=3610s` (log,
  14:24:10). A reap that looks hours late usually is not: read the log's
  `stagnant Ns` field before concluding the timer failed. Related: a wedged
  worker keeps its `cmd.exe` shim alive, so a pid check alone says RUNNING —
  the underlying `opencode run` node process is the one that matters.
- **Whether a worker commits `RESULT.json` varies, and it changes the landing
  dance.** Four of session 13's six left it uncommitted in the worktree (copy
  it to the repo root yourself before `land_packet.py`); two committed it, so
  it arrived **tracked** on the merge and `land_packet.py` refused on the
  dirty tree until `git checkout -- RESULT.json`. Read the merge stat: a
  `create mode 100644 RESULT.json` line means the committed flavor.
- **Derive every pair's algebra to the end before fixing shared enum arms.**
  Session 13 added `Curves(Vec<ExactCurve>)` for coaxial torus families it
  believed could meet in four circles, then proved — one line of algebra
  later — that outer and inner contacts are mutually exclusive and share the
  squared equation, capping every family at two. The arm was added and
  dropped in two commits. Arms are cheap before dispatch and impossible
  after; so is the algebra that justifies them.
- **A verify launched through anything with a timeout is a verify you will
  kill, and killing one leaks its baseline worktree.** Session 12 ran three
  verifies inside a backgrounded shell wrapper whose harness cap is 600 s. A
  verify takes longer than that. The wrapper was killed mid-build, all three
  child verifies died with it, and three baseline worktrees (~1.3 GB) and three
  stale `loop/slots/N/verify.pid` files were left behind — the exact leak
  ORCHESTRATOR.md already warns about, walked into anyway. **Launch a verify
  detached** (`Start-Process` on Windows) so no caller's timeout can reach it,
  and poll `loop/slots/N/VERDICT.json` for the result instead of waiting on the
  process. Recovery, if it happens again: `git worktree remove --force` each
  `%TEMP%/look-verify-baseline-*/wt`, `rm -rf` the parents, `git worktree
  prune`, `rm -f loop/slots/*/verify.pid`. Nothing is lost — the packet branches
  are untouched and the verify just re-runs.
- **Never run two verifies at the same base concurrently.** They each build a
  baseline keyed by (base commit, test set) and will race on it, and "a baseline
  cached from a corrupted build" is already one of the three harness lies that
  cost session 11. Session 12 dispatched three packets from two distinct bases
  and ran the verifies **sequentially** for this reason. Related and harmless
  but alarming the first time: concurrent verifies each report the *others'*
  live baselines as "leaked worktrees", because the warning cannot distinguish a
  concurrent baseline from an abandoned one. Under sequential runs it goes away.
- **Read the carrier source; do not enclose the handoff's description of it.**
  Session 12's handoff said `Processor`'s `orientation() == false` "flips the
  normal cone axis". It does not: `Processor::subs` evaluates
  `entity.subs(v, u)` and `der_mn` swaps the orders *and* the arguments, so the
  parameters are transposed. A packet written to the description would have
  produced an enclosure that does not contain its own surface — an
  under-estimation, which BG-ENC-001 calls a silent wrong answer, and one that
  the *sampling* test would have caught only if the test box were asymmetric.
  The same ten minutes in `processor.rs` also turned up the projective divide in
  `transform_point`, and the same habit applied to `offset/mod.rs` is what found
  the `Offset` type error. This is the general rule ("re-derive every claim by
  running a command") applied to prose about types, where it is easiest to skip
  because the prose is confident and specific.
- **A `grep 'pub fn '` misses `pub const fn` and will convince you a type has no
  getters.** Every accessor `BG-ENC-004` needed — `Processor::entity`,
  `transform`, `orientation`, `ExtrudedCurve::entity_curve`,
  `extruding_vector`, `RevolutedCurve::origin`, `axis`, `Offset::entity`,
  `offset` — is `pub const fn`. Grep `pub \(const \)\?fn`.
- **Pseudocode in a packet must satisfy the lints the packet mandates.** Three
  ENC-004 packets specified a guard as `if !(cn > rho)`, and the same packets
  mandate `clippy -D warnings`, under which `neg_cmp_op_on_partial_ord` rejects
  exactly that. Two workers rewrote it to `cn <= rho` and reported it in
  `notes` — correctly, but the two forms **differ on NaN** (`!(x > y)` is true,
  `x <= y` is false), so the rewrite is only safe because an explicit
  `!cn.is_finite()` guard sits beside it. That was checked in the landed code
  rather than taken from the notes, and it held in all three. The lesson is
  cheap to apply: any comparison, cast or arithmetic a packet spells out will be
  typed in verbatim by the worker and then linted, so spell it out in the form
  that passes.
- **`schedule.py` honours `BLOCKED` now, and did not before.** It skipped only
  `RUNNING` and `DONE`, so a packet whose dependencies were all satisfied but
  which had been found undispatchable listed as eligible **forever**.
  `BG-INV-107` was reclassified BLOCKED in session 10 and was reported
  dispatchable in every frontier from then until session 12 — that is where the
  "17 eligible" and "16 eligible" counts came from, both inflated. Filing
  `BG-ENC-004-OFFSET` BLOCKED made it two. A status the scheduler does not know
  is a status that does not exist; putting the reason only in `note` does not
  stop the next session from dispatching the row.

- **A gate that fails on the untouched baseline is not a gate.** The vendored
  tree is nowhere near clippy-clean (truck-meshalgo ~93 lints,
  `revolved_curve.rs:694` "items after a test module") and **not rustfmt-clean
  either** (`revolved_curve.rs:690`, a stray blank line, present at base). Its
  test suite is not clean either (`healing::tests::step_import` needs an absent
  STEP file; `tests/fillet.rs::complex_surface` triangulates to `Irregular`).
  V3 is scoped to the **lines the diff added** (clippy) and the **files the diff
  changed** (fmt); V5 to the **test fns the diff added**.
- **The fmt half of V3 was whole-crate for five sessions** and cost
  BG-NUM-001-FILLET its sixth rejection — on a file the packet never opened and
  *could not have fixed*, because it was outside its own `write_allow`. That
  combination is the signature of a gate defect: when the only way to get green
  is to violate another gate, it is not the worker who is wrong. Fixed in
  `ec34aa0`. **fmt is scoped by file, not by line** — rustfmt reports where its
  diff *context* starts, several lines above the text it wants to change, so
  intersecting those numbers with added lines both misses real findings and
  invents absent ones.
- **`git grep` exits 1 when it matches nothing, and under `set -o pipefail`
  that kills the whole script.** GATE-4's first run on a clean tree exited 1
  with **zero output** — every earlier gate unreported, indistinguishable from
  a crash. The `|| true` inside the command substitution is load-bearing.
- **`kernel-gates.sh` reads `HEAD`, not the worktree.** Staging a probe is not
  enough to trip GATE-4; the negative test has to commit. This matches V4's
  timing, which runs after the worker commits.
- **Watch a gate fail before trusting it, and commit it first.** The negative
  test for GATE-4 ended in `git reset --hard`, which reverted the *uncommitted
  gate itself*. Commit the gate, then probe, then reset.
- **rustfmt moves a trailing `// H-3` comment off a brace-opener line.** The
  opt-out only works on the same line as the literal, so rustfmt silently
  defeats it. Extract the literal onto its own statement line. (Worker-reported,
  BG-TOL-001-TYPE-r2.)
- **`rg` is not installed on this host.** H-8 anchors are still `rg` patterns
  and workers check them with whatever grep they have. Verify anchors yourself
  before dispatch; do not write a packet that shells out to `rg`.
- **Dead code looks exactly like live code.** `truck-shapeops/src/fillet/
  experiment.rs` holds 5 tolerance sites and is not compiled — `fillet/mod.rs`
  carries `//mod experiment;`. A fifth of the SHAPEOPS shard would have been
  unverifiable edits to a file nothing builds. Check that a module is actually
  declared before putting it in a write set.
- **Not every use of `TOLERANCE` is a predicate.**
  `polyline_construction/mod.rs:32` uses it as a spatial-hash bucket pitch. It
  compares nothing, so it has no `model`/`param` classification, and a
  mechanical migration would have produced nonsense that still compiled.
- **Legacy `.near()` is componentwise; `ToleranceCtx::near_pt` is Euclidean.**
  Not the same predicate — Euclidean is stricter by up to `sqrt(3)`. Every Stage-A
  shard is therefore a small deliberate tightening. A test that moves because of
  it is a finding to report, never a tolerance to widen.
- **A write set has to cover the ripple, not just the edit.** BG-NUM-001-FILLET
  changed one function's signature and was rejected for touching its only
  caller, in another crate. Grep for callers of anything whose signature a
  packet changes before writing `write_allow`.
- **A ceiling a packet can raise is not a ratchet.**
  `scripts/unscaled_legacy_ceiling.txt` is deliberately outside every shard's
  `write_allow`; the orchestrator raises it before dispatch and lowers it after.
**Already fixed in the harness — do not undo these.** Each cost a session; the
reason is in the commit that made the change, and the code will not tell you.

- **V5 uses `--no-fail-fast`**: without it cargo stops at the first failing test
  binary and never reaches the packet's own `tests/*.rs`, so it reported PASS on
  something it never ran.
- **V5 diffs a cached baseline** rather than scoping to added lines the way V3
  does: a test failure is not located in the diff, and scoping it there
  discards regression detection instead of noise.
- **V0 allow-lists `*.obj` specifically** rather than ignoring untracked files —
  `cargo test` drops mesh dumps into the worktree the verifier is judging, but
  an uncommitted new `.rs` is exactly what V0 exists to catch.
- **V0 exists because an interrupted run reads as a perfect one**: a worker that
  dies mid-packet leaves its edits uncommitted, an empty diff that passes V1–V6.
- **The dispatch uses `CREATE_NO_WINDOW | CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP |
  CREATE_BREAKAWAY_FROM_JOB`, never `DETACHED_PROCESS`**, which silences the
  worker it is meant to free, and writes its redirect into a command file
  because `opencode` is a `.cmd` shim with an 8191-char command line. **Run
  `python loop/selftest_dispatch.py` after touching any of this.**
- **V4 hardcodes Git Bash** — a bare `bash` is the WSL stub.
- **`slot_status.py --kill-stalled`** reaps anything silent for 12 min; only
  `events.jsonl` growth distinguishes a hang from a worker thinking.
- **`autotests = false` in truck-polymesh**: a new test file there needs an
  explicit `[[test]]` entry or it silently never runs. V6 flags this.
- **`truck_base::evidence`, not `truck_evidence`** — the module lives in
  truck-base to avoid a geotrait→evidence cycle.

- **This loop can eat 40 GB of disk in one session, and did.** Free space went
  40 GB → **0.1 GB**. Two causes, both in the verifier. Every V9/V5 baseline
  builds a *whole extra workspace* in a throwaway worktree under the system
  temp dir, and `compute_baseline`'s cleanup is best-effort with a comment
  calling a leftover "harmless" — it is not, each one is ~1.3 GB and they
  accumulate per distinct (base, test-set) key. And a probe that edits
  `truck-base` invalidates every downstream crate, so a slot's `target/` grew
  4.4 → 12.9 GB across three negative-test runs. Recovery is easy and total:
  delete `loop/slots/*/target` (a slot re-warms in 1-3 min) and any
  `%TEMP%/look-verify-baseline-*`, then `git worktree prune`. **Check
  `Get-PSDrive C` before a run of repeated verifies, not after.**
- **A negative test leaves the repo on the broken commit.** Probing V9 meant
  committing `TOLERANCE = 1.0e-1` on `integration/kernel-bg` in the *main*
  worktree and pointing a slot at it. When the run was interrupted, the repo
  root sat on that commit with the kernel's tolerance five orders of magnitude
  wrong. Nothing downstream noticed, because nothing was watching. Reset the
  main worktree and delete the probe branch as part of the probe, not after it.
- **Dead text looks exactly like live code, and it reached a packet.** The
  SHAPEOPS site table listed `fillet/mod.rs:615`, which sits inside a `/* */`
  block spanning lines 500–662. The worker migrated a comment, as instructed,
  and said so plainly — it was right and the packet was wrong. `git grep` and
  the census both counted it, and GATE-4 counted the resulting phantom scaffold
  call. The census now skips `/* */`; **a module declared out with a commented
  `mod` statement still slips through** (`experiment.rs`, 5 sites), because
  detecting that needs the declaration, not the file. Check the `mod` statement
  before putting a file in a write set.
- **A ceiling left at its dispatch budget is a licence, not a ratchet.**
  GATE-4's ceiling was raised to 20 to dispatch SHAPEOPS and lowered to the
  true 11 in the same session. Lower it in the commit that closes the packet.
- **A raw grep for tolerance sites is off by 3x, in both directions.**
  `python loop/census_tol_sites.py` splits them: **238 production predicates**,
  plus 66 doc-comment examples, 4 `#[strategy = TOLERANCE..]` test-input bounds,
  2 in-src test assertions and 22 squared-order sites — none of which are
  migration work. truck-modeling reads as 34 sites and has **11**; truck-topology
  reads as 14 and has **4**; truck-meshalgo was recorded here as 375 and has
  **45**, so it never needed the split earlier sessions planned. Size a shard
  with the census, and note the production total is *higher* than the spec's
  stated 184, not lower.
- **The spec goes stale invisibly.** Re-run every anchor when you touch a packet.
- **A spec gap is the loop's most valuable output, not a failure.** Session 6's
  two amendments both came from writing a packet and finding the spec had not
  decided something. Fix the spec *and* the packet; never only the packet.
- **CI gates are still vacuous.** `kernel-gates.sh` is diff-scoped and
  `origin/main` has no `vendor/truck/`, so CI passes on nothing. Packet
  verification is unaffected — its baseline is the branch tip.

- **A packet's budget is a claim about the repo, and claims rot.** Session 7
  found two in one packet: the anchor table was **wrong when written** (3 of 7
  counts, on files unchanged since before the packet existed — so not drift),
  and `unscaled_legacy_budget` was an estimate ("about 12 here") against a true
  19. Both would have been caught by running a command instead of reading a
  file. `run_packet.py` now refuses to dispatch when GATE-4's count plus the
  declared budget exceeds the ceiling **committed on the slot's own branch** —
  raising it on `integration/kernel-bg` after the slot forked does nothing.
- **The budget is one context per FUNCTION with a site, not per site or per
  file.** `census_tol_sites.py <path-fragment>` prints it. Keying those
  functions by (file, name) undercounts: `truck-stepio/src/out/geometry.rs` has
  five distinct `fmt` impls each holding a site, which collapsed to one and made
  the crate read 11 instead of 15.
- **V5 reads a flaky proptest as a regression.** It compares one run of a
  randomized suite at base against one run at HEAD.
  `truck-geometry/tests/bspcurve.rs::parameter_random_tests` fails
  occasionally by ~3e-6 against a 1e-6 tolerance; it did so once during
  GEOM-SPECIFIEDS' verify, in a file the packet never opened. 12 subsequent
  runs — 6 at base, 6 on the branch, with the failing seed present — all
  passed. **Before believing a V5 failure in a file the packet did not touch,
  re-run it at both commits.**
- **A gate that blocks its own retry turns a flake into a permanent
  rejection.** That same proptest failure wrote
  `tests/bspcurve.proptest-regressions`, and V0's ignore rule only matched a
  *directory* of that name, so every later verify on the slot BLOCKED on the
  artifact left by the run being re-measured. Fixed in `aa2dadd`.
- **Backticks in a `git commit -m` message are command substitution.** A commit
  message quoting a command name in backticks hung the shell for two minutes and
  committed nothing. Write the message to a file and use `-F`.
- **Two workers on write-disjoint packets run concurrently without trouble** —
  first demonstrated in session 7 (slots 0 and 1, both editing `truck-geometry`
  but disjoint files). The open question about concurrency was about the *free*
  model tier and is still open.

- **A survey's `proposed_rewrite` can be right about the class and wrong about
  the code, and the schema is what lets it happen.** One row, one rewrite. When
  a source line carries two predicates of different classes —
  `if !previous_uv.x.near(&current_uv.x) && surface.uder(u, v).so_small()` — the
  survey classified for the deciding test and proposed
  `ctx.is_small_len(surface.uder(u, v).magnitude())`, which is the correct
  migration of that predicate and **silently deletes the guard**. The worker knew
  and said so in its own `reason`; it had nowhere else to put it. Four of the 26
  rows were like this, and they are exactly the four it marked `confidence: low`
  — the confidence field worked. The survey template now carries
  `predicates_on_line` and `mixed_classification`, and requires
  `proposed_rewrite` to replace the **whole condition**. **When reviewing a
  survey, grep the source lines for a second predicate token before trusting any
  rewrite.**
- **`model` means degree ONE in length, and nothing enforces that.** A
  cross-product magnitude is twice a triangle's area; a `Matrix3::determinant()`
  of two displacements and a unit direction is a scalar triple product. Both
  scale as `k²` while `ctx.length_margin()` scales as `k`, so
  `ctx.is_small_len(area)` is exactly correct at Stage A — where `model_scale =
  1.0` makes the two identical — and silently wrong the moment Stage B threads a
  real scale. **That is worse than not migrating**, because Stage B sees a
  migrated site and never looks again. Six such sites in `truck-meshalgo` were
  proposed as `model`; a worker on an earlier shard had already hit the identical
  problem unprompted and left `FIXME(BG-TOL-001)` at
  `truck-modeling/src/geom_impls.rs:91`. The spec now records this as a third
  exclusion class alongside squared-order. **The tell is in the reason text: if a
  classification's own justification contains "area" or "length-squared", it is
  not `model`.**
- **Recognise a squared-order site by its CONSTANT, not by its shape.**
  `d.distance2(c) <= TOLERANCE * TOLERANCE` is *not* the `near2` family — it is
  algebraically `distance <= TOLERANCE`, an ordinary first-order predicate
  written squared to skip a `sqrt`, and it migrates. What cannot migrate is a
  comparison against `TOLERANCE2` = 1e-12, because nothing on `ToleranceCtx`
  reproduces that number. The survey excluded a live site by getting this
  backwards, and the census miscounts the same line in the other direction —
  its SQUARED regex matches the `TOLERANCE2` *token* and not a written-out
  `TOLERANCE * TOLERANCE`.
- **A `const` item is never a migration site.** `pub const FOO: f64 = TOLERANCE;`
  has no `ctx` in scope, so any `ctx.` rewrite proposed for one cannot compile.
  Same for a `use` import, a `.max(TOLERANCE)` floor and a `+ TOLERANCE` offset:
  they compare nothing, so they have no class. Their *consumers* are the sites.
  This is the same family as the spatial-hash bucket pitch already recorded, and
  it is much wider than that one instance — four of `truck-meshalgo`'s 30 census
  "production predicates" are value computations, not predicates.
- **`census_tol_sites.py` cannot see a constant whose name ends in
  `_TOLERANCE`.** Its pattern needs a word boundary before `TOLERANCE` and `_` is
  a word character, so `SOURCE_INCIDENCE_TOLERANCE` and `RELATIVE_TOLERANCE` are
  invisible. The survey found three hits this way, one of them a live predicate
  (`source_edge.rs:311`), and `tessellation/formal/*.rs` holds **8 more
  production predicates on a hardcoded `RELATIVE_TOLERANCE = 1e-9` that are in no
  inventory at all**. Treat the census's totals as a floor. (Not fixed: widening
  the regex changes every crate's number under the shards already sized against
  it, so do it deliberately, in its own commit, and re-size.)
- **`--skeleton` and `--check` disagreed with each other, and `--check` won.**
  `gen_packet --skeleton` computed `unscaled_legacy_budget` from the survey's live
  rows (16) while `--check` validated it against the census function count (20),
  and `run_packet.py` refuses to dispatch on the mismatch — so **no
  survey-derived packet could be dispatched at all**. The census counts every
  function holding a grep hit, including ones whose only hits a packet correctly
  excludes, so the two numbers diverge by construction, not by error. The budget
  is now checked against the packet's own site table, with the census kept as a
  ceiling. **A gate whose two halves are computed from different sources is a
  gate that will eventually reject correct work.**
- **Resolve a packet's site table against the tree, not against its own text.**
  The first version of that budget parser keyed on the function name and read
  `BG-TOL-001-STEPIO` as 10 contexts against a true 15 — reproducing the exact
  undercount already in the traps (five distinct `fmt` impls in
  `truck-stepio/src/out/geometry.rs` collapsing to one). It was also brittle
  across packet styles: MESHALGO's generated table states the class in the row
  and STEPIO's states it in the section heading, so a regex tuned to one counts
  zero rows in the other and reports a mismatch that is the parser's. Resolving
  `(file, line)` to the enclosing `fn`'s definition line fixes both and checks
  one more thing for free — a table line that lands outside any function does not
  resolve, so an invented line number cannot pad a budget.
- **A green line can state something false.** Watching the new budget gate fail
  on "budget above the census ceiling" showed it printing
  `budget 25 <= census ceiling 20  ok` — the comparison silently used the counted
  value instead of the declared one. The real error was caught by the other half
  of the same check, so nothing leaked; the message was wrong anyway, and a
  wrong-but-green line is exactly what a later session reads and believes. **Read
  what a gate prints on the negative test, not just its exit code.**
- **`gen_packet --skeleton` writes UTF-8 through a cp1252 console.** Its em
  dashes came back as `?` on screen and `--check` died with `UnicodeDecodeError`
  reading back the file `--skeleton` had just produced. Fixed producer-side with
  `sys.stdout.reconfigure(encoding='utf-8')`. Any new `loop/*.py` that prints
  prose needs the same line.
- **`new_slot.py` can exceed a two-minute tool timeout and still have
  succeeded.** It warms a cold slot, which takes ~5.6 min. A timeout is not a
  failure — check `slot_status.py` and `git worktree list` before re-running it,
  or you will fork a second worktree onto the same branch.

- **"`Plane` implements `BoundedSurface` despite being unbounded" is false, and
  it reached a packet as a stated fact.** `Plane::parameter_range` is
  `(Bound::Included(0.0), Bound::Included(1.0))` on both axes; `range_tuple`'s
  `.expect(UNBOUNDED_ERROR)` cannot fire on it. `Cylinder` and `Cone` are the
  ones that are unbounded — `(Bound::Unbounded, Bound::Unbounded)` in `v` — so
  the panic the claim described is real and lives on the other types. The worker
  that was told this contradicted it in its `RESULT.json` notes and was right.
  **The packet asked for that judgement explicitly** ("report whether Plane's
  impl looked like a defect to you on reading it"), which is the only reason it
  came back; a packet that states a fact without inviting disagreement gets
  compliance instead of a correction.

- **A crate that denies its own lints makes V3 unpassable, and "could not
  compile" does not mean "was not linted".** `truck-meshalgo/src/lib.rs` carries
  `#![deny(clippy::all, rust_2018_idioms)]`, so its ~93 pre-existing lints are
  hard errors whatever V3 puts on the command line; cargo then reports "could not
  compile ... due to 93 previous errors" and V3's coverage guard fired on that,
  short-circuiting the added-line scoping which is the gate's whole purpose.
  Every finding was in files the diff never opened and V2 passed on the same
  tree. **The distinguishing marker is `error[E####]`** -- rustc gives a real
  compile error a code and never gives one to a lint. Fixed; a crate counts as
  unlinted only when an E-coded diagnostic is present, so the guard keeps its
  property. Watched failing three ways first.
- **GATE-1 requires `#![deny(clippy::unwrap_used)]` on every new module under
  `vendor/truck/`, including `tests/*.rs`, and a packet that does not say so gets
  rejected for the orchestrator's omission.** BG-TOL-001-MESHALGO's packet never
  contained the string `unwrap_used`; both landed shards' test files carry the
  attribute, so the convention existed and only the packet was missing it. Fixed
  by amendment rather than redispatch. **Put this line in every packet that asks
  for a new test file.**
- **Do not read a verdict off a background wrapper's exit code.** A command of
  the form `python loop/verify.py ... > log; echo "EXIT: $?" >> log` exits with
  the *echo's* status, so the task notification says 0 while the log says
  REJECTED. This was reported to the user as an acceptance before the log was
  read. **Read `VERDICT.json` or the `VERDICT:` line, never the harness's exit
  notification.**
- **`kill -0 <pid>` in Git Bash cannot see a Windows PID and reports the process
  dead.** A watch built on it fired instantly with "pid gone" while the worker
  was alive and working. Use `tasklist //FI "PID eq N"`, or better,
  `slot_status.py`'s own state.
- **`slot_status.py`'s 12-minute STALLED threshold is mis-calibrated for this
  worker.** Measured on BG-TOL-001-MESHALGO: **75% of the run's wall clock was
  model latency**, in five gaps of 6-10 minutes, some of them followed by a
  `grep` on a local file that takes milliseconds. A 12.9-minute gap tripped
  STALLED on a worker that then resumed and finished normally. **`--kill-stalled`
  on that label would have destroyed an hour of correct work.** Confirm with
  `tasklist` and check whether cargo/rustc are running before reaping anything.
- **A bash heredoc eats backslashes, and it has now corrupted three separate
  Python patches in one session** -- `'\'` collapsing to `''` (unterminated
  string), and `'\b'` arriving as a literal 0x08 backspace inside a regex that
  then silently matched nothing. **Write Python patch scripts to a file and run
  the file, or use the Edit tool; never pipe a patch containing regex escapes
  through a heredoc.**
- **Worker cost is not a constraint and orchestrator time is.** The whole
  BG-TOL-001-MESHALGO run cost **$0.057**; all 49 remaining packets extrapolate
  to about **$2.78**. Parallelism therefore buys wall-clock but never credits,
  and it *raises* orchestrator load because every finished worker needs
  adjudicating. **43% of a packet's text is templatable boilerplate and only
  ~29% is real judgement** -- that ratio, not slot count, is where the leverage
  is.

- **`--base` is per-slot, not per-session, and slots forked at different moments
  have different fork points.** Session 9 created slot 0, then committed a
  harness fix, then created slots 2 and 4. Verifying slot 2 with slot 0's base
  put `loop/new_slot.py` -- the orchestrator's own commit -- inside the packet's
  diff, and V1 correctly rejected it for a file no worker touched. The gate was
  right and the invocation was wrong. **Read the fork point off the slot**
  (`git -C loop/slots/N/wt rev-parse HEAD~1` for a single-commit packet) rather
  than reusing the base from the last verify.
- **`PACKET.md` is worker scaffolding and must not reach the integration
  branch.** `run_packet.py` writes it into each worktree root; a `--no-ff` merge
  carries it in, and the *next* packet's merge then hits
  `CONFLICT (content): PACKET.md`, because every slot's copy is a different
  packet. It stopped two landings in a row before it was removed from tracking.
  This is the same rule already recorded for `RESULT.json` and it applies for
  the same reason: the authoritative packet is in `loop/packets/`, the
  authoritative result in `loop/results/`, and neither belongs in the repo root.
- **`git add -A` at the repo root sweeps in deliberately-untracked work.** This
  repo carries a dozen untracked analysis documents, `benchmarks/` outputs and
  all of `scratch/`. One `git add -A` put 196 files into a commit before it was
  caught and the commit rebuilt from `git add loop/ docs/ scripts/`. Stage the
  paths the commit is actually about.
- **A `model` site can be correctly classified and still unmigratable, and it
  has now cost three shards.** `ctx.near_points<P>` needs
  `P: MetricSpace<Metric = f64>`; `P: ControlPoint<f64> + Tolerance` does not
  supply it, and `Homogeneous::Point` is only `EuclideanSpace`. **Run
  `python loop/check_metric_bound.py <survey.json>` before writing any TOL
  packet.** It resolves every `model` row to its enclosing impl or free fn and
  reports MIGRATES / BLOCKED / CHECK; validated against all three of session 9's
  shards, whose answers were known by hand, with zero false negatives on 47
  rows. Two sites with the *same function name and the same shape* can take
  different rewrites -- `truck-geotrait`'s two `search_parameter`s do.
- **`const fn` blocks a migration outright.** `nurbs/mod.rs`'s `inv_or_zero` is
  a `pub const fn` and `ToleranceCtx::unscaled_legacy()` is not const, so no
  context can exist in that body. The packet demanded the rewrite while its
  Forbidden clause banned signature changes; the worker dropped `const`,
  reported the contradiction, and was right that both could not hold. Now a
  named exclusion class, `FIXME(BG-TOL-001, CONST_FN)`. **Grep a shard's site
  list for `const fn` before writing the packet.** This is the first exclusion
  where the classification and the rewrite are both *correct* and the enclosing
  item is what blocks them.
- **GATE-4 counts `unscaled_legacy(` anywhere in the file, comments included.**
  A `FIXME` explaining why a site cannot be migrated will naturally name the
  constructor, inflating the ratchet by one and making a *deferral* read as a
  *migration*. The NURBS amendment's own FIXME did exactly this and held GATE-4
  at 76 when the tree had 75. Write the name without its parentheses in prose.
- **A checker can DROP rows rather than miscount them, and print green either
  way.** `gen_packet.packet_contexts` resolved a site table's file heading with
  a bare-basename `endswith`, so `curve.rs` also matched `polyline_curve.rs`;
  two candidates made the heading ambiguous and **every row beneath it was
  skipped silently** while the tool printed "all checked claims hold". Two
  packets read low by one and two contexts. A skipped row is never resolved
  against the tree at all, which is the one thing that function exists to do.
  A second bug hid the first: the no-table path returned a hardcoded `[]` for
  `unresolved`, so the guard could not have reported it even once it existed.
- **`git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree` cannot tell a linked worktree from any
  directory inside the repo, and `new_slot` used it to decide.** A stub
  `loop/slots/N/wt/` holding a leftover `vendor/` was classified live, and the
  idempotent path then ran `git -C wt checkout -B packet/<id>` and
  `reset --hard` -- both repo-wide, both resolving to the **main worktree**,
  which was silently moved onto a packet branch. Nothing was lost only because
  every ref sat on the same commit and the tree was clean. The test is now
  `rev-parse --show-toplevel` compared against the path itself, plus a flat
  refusal to treat the repo root as a slot.
- **An interrupted verify leaks its baseline worktree, and that is what actually
  fills the disk.** `compute_baseline`'s cleanup does not run when the process
  is killed. Two leaked baselines plus one live one took session 9 from 9.4 GB
  to 3.1 GB and cost it a completed run. `verify.py` now names them and their
  size both in the 8 GB refusal and as a warning while there is still room to
  act; the deletion is still yours.
- **`loop/slots/*/target` is only half the disk the loop owns.** Workers create
  a *second* `target/` **inside** the worktree -- `loop/slots/N/wt/target` --
  despite `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` pointing elsewhere, and it is the larger of the
  two: 1.9 GB against 0.9 GB in one slot. Every recovery recipe in these
  documents named only the outer one. `slot_status.py --disk` reports both.
- **Most of this machine's missing disk is not the loop's.** Session 9 found
  **19 GB** of regenerable junk in `%TEMP%`: 118 `chrome-lite-*` throwaway
  browser profiles at ~125 MB each (14.7 GB) and 28 `proc-macro-srv*`
  rust-analyzer server copies (4.2 GB), all under three days old. Check those
  before concluding the loop needs a smaller footprint.
- **A dead worker can leave its `cmd.exe` shim alive, so a pid check says
  RUNNING.** Two workers died in an ~8-hour gap with their recorded pids still
  resolving. What separates them is `events.jsonl` mtime *plus* whether any
  `cargo`/`rustc` process exists at all. `slot_status.py` shows `DEAD?` when the
  log has been silent over an hour and no toolchain process exists. **It is a
  prompt to look, never grounds to reap** -- the opposite mis-calibration on
  `STALLED` is recorded above and cost an hour of correct work.
- **Never background a verify through a shell wrapper.** `nohup python
  loop/verify.py ... &` inside a backgrounded compound either never runs or is
  orphaned, the wrapper reports exit 0, and the **stale `VERDICT.json` from the
  previous packet is still in the slot**, ready to be read as this one's.
  Session 9 read an ACCEPTED verdict for MESHALGO and nearly believed it was
  NURBS's. Check `VERDICT.json`'s `base` and `commit` match the run you think
  you are reading.
- **`cd` persists across a compound command and `-F` resolves against it.** A
  `cd` into a slot worktree followed by `git commit -F scratch/msg.txt` looked
  for the message *inside the worktree* and died. The `git -C` rule is not only
  about committing to the wrong branch; use absolute paths for `-F` too.
- **`land_packet.py` must run BEFORE the stray `RESULT.json` is deleted.** It
  reads `RESULT.json` from the repo root -- where it arrives on the merge -- and
  files it. Deleting it first makes `land_packet` die with `FileNotFoundError`.
  Order: merge, `land_packet`, then delete.
- **A carrier packet that does not spell out H-3 will be rejected for H-3.**
  GATE-2 is a text gate on the diff: any *added* line with a bare `1e-N`
  literal fails unless that line ends `// H-3`. It cannot tell an angle from a
  length and it does not exempt tests. `BG-CE-006-ENUM-r3` lost a verify to one
  such line, `BG-ENC-002-LINE` to one, and `BG-ENC-002-CIRCLE` to six — three
  packets, three round trips, one cause. A packet that says "named consts; a
  `// H-3` same-line opt-out if a bare float is ever unavoidable" in its test
  section is **not** enough: it reads as a style note. The four remaining
  carrier packets now carry a dedicated section with the house form copied out
  and the instruction to run `scripts/kernel-gates.sh` before writing
  RESULT.json. Copy that section into every new kernel packet.
- **The watchdog cannot tell a landed slot from a dead worker.** After
  `land_packet.py` moves RESULT.json out of the worktree, a finished slot has
  no pid, no RESULT.json and no event growth — Rule B exactly. It redispatched
  `BG-ENC-002-LINE` minutes after that packet merged, and the new worker took a
  lock on `events.jsonl` that made the next real dispatch die with
  `PermissionError: [WinError 32]`. Fixed by asking PACKETS.jsonl: a slot whose
  packet row reads DONE is left alone. **Reset a slot with `new_slot.py`
  promptly after landing** rather than leaving it looking abandoned.
- **A reaper that reads `worker.pid` thinks a verifying slot is idle.**
  `worker.pid` disappears the moment the worker writes `RESULT.json`, but
  `verify.py` then spends 10-30 minutes compiling in that same `target/`.
  `watchdog.py`'s `guard_disk` read slot 0 as idle and `rmtree`d
  `loop/slots/0/target` under a live cargo three times on 2026-08-19 (its own
  log, `22:33:04 ACTION disk 3.4 GB free: reclaimed 3.7 GB`, and at 22:43:20 an
  `Access is denied` on a `.dll` it was deleting while cargo held it open).
  The resulting `error[E0786] found invalid metadata files for crate`,
  `error[E0463] can't find crate for truck_stepio` and `failed to write
  ...dep-lib-truck_meshalgo` were all diagnosed as **code regressions in the
  packet under test**, on unchanged source, after repeated clean builds. Two
  hypotheses died on that. `verify.py` now writes `loop/slots/<N>/verify.pid`
  and the watchdog reclaims nothing while one is alive; it also takes leaked
  `%TEMP%/look-verify-baseline-*` worktrees, which are pure garbage from killed
  verifies, before any warm target. **Deleting a warm target is not a disk
  strategy** -- it frees the same bytes and then charges the next verify a full
  cold rebuild, which is how that session made every retry cost more than the
  last.
- **Never cache a baseline whose build did not compile.** Such a file measures
  the disk, not the base commit, and afterwards it is indistinguishable from a
  real one and is trusted by every later verify against that base. A cached
  `a08fd8f` baseline recorded `geometry::b_spline_curve_with_knots = ok` while
  the test failed 3/3 when run at that exact commit; V8 charged r3 for a
  failure it had not caused, twice, and the session's response was to weaken
  the gate (`bfb598b`, since reverted) on a flakiness theory that direct
  measurement had already falsified. **Ask whether the evidence is real before
  you ask whether the gate is wrong.**
- **cargo splits test output across two streams and `stdout + stderr` destroys
  the order.** The `Running <target> (<exe>)` banners go to stderr, the `test
  name ... ok` lines to stdout; captured as two pipes and concatenated, every
  banner lands after every test line and no test can be attributed to the
  target it ran in. `invoke_native` and both baseline runners now merge stderr
  into stdout (`stderr=subprocess.STDOUT`). V8's narrow base query depends on
  that attribution: without it every failing test falls back to rebuilding the
  whole downstream workspace at base, which is the cost the redesign removes.
- **A base build failure is never the packet's fault.** The base commit
  predates the packet; if it will not build, that is disk, toolchain or a
   corrupt target dir. V8 now exits **BLOCKED** rather than REJECTED when it
   cannot get an answer out of the base, and caches nothing from that run.

- **A sampling property test must clamp its grid into the box it quantifies
  over.** `plane_enclose_is_sound` sampled `u0 + (u1-u0)*20/20` at the last
  grid index — a multiply-then-divide round trip that landed one ulp ABOVE
  `u1` (seed `e2369bfc`: 1.6356989675203588 → 1.635698967520359) — and the
  point evaluated there escaped Plane's correctly-rounded affine box by one
  ulp. The enclosure was sound the whole time; the same-tree
  interval-induction argument never failed, and the "escape" was the test
  asserting a false property (soundness outside the box). Two sessions
  misread it as a BG-ENC-001 under-estimation. The shared P-6 harness
  (`harness.rs`) carried the identical latent defect, masked only by every
  other carrier's enclosure slack. Both samplers clamp now and the seed is
  committed, so the case replays in every worktree. **Every packet whose
  tests sample a computed grid against a tight enclosure must clamp (or pin
  exact endpoints) and say why in the test.**

- **`run_packet.py --reset` clears the working tree; it does NOT re-fork the
  branch.** After a SPEC_GAP or a dead run, resetting the slot with
  `--reset` leaves the branch sitting on the old commits, so the next
  worker builds on top of them (tracked QUESTION.md/RESULT.json ride into
  the diff → V1 rejection) and measures against a stale base. The correct
  redispatch sequence is `new_slot.py --slot N --branch packet/<ID>` (which
  re-forks onto integration HEAD) **then** `run_packet.py` (no `--reset`
  needed on a clean fresh fork). Session 14 paid one worker kill for
  learning this — caught it only because `slot_status` showed the old
  commit instead of `(=base, no work)` after the redispatch.

- **A handoff's "loose ends" list rots as fast as any other prose.** Session
  14's handoff said BG-TOL-001-SMALL was "still unadjudicated, not
  mergeable unverified" — the registry and ledger said it was DONE two
  sessions earlier (`8f4f04d`, ACCEPTED, merged as `901f0ac`, fault GATE).
  The leftover branch ref `72e2b89` on the pre-landing base is what fooled
  the handoff. **Read `PACKETS.jsonl` and `LEDGER.jsonl` for status, never
  the handoff's own summary of them** — and never start a rebase/verify of
  an "unadjudicated" packet without that check first.

- **A decisive boundary classification needs dyadic data on the PRIMARY
  parameters, and multi-step interval polynomials never degenerate.**
  inari rounds every intermediate outward, so a polynomial expression of an
  exact-zero quantity evaluates to `[−ε, 0]` or `[0, ε]`, never `[0, 0]` —
  `decisively_zero` can only fire on short exactly-representable chains.
  The PCONE parabola rule died on this (spec amendment entry 4). The
  escape: classify on the primary parameters with a scale-free invariant,
  and choose witnesses with **integer raw normals and a dyadic slope** —
  `tan α = 3/4` is dyadic where `sin α = 3/5` is not, and no nontrivial
  Pythagorean triple has a power-of-two hypotenuse, so no unit vector with
  dyadic components exists at all. The same arithmetic limits apply to any
  future "exactly on the boundary" witness.

- **Verify a packet's own arithmetic with a command before dispatch.** The
  amended PCONE packet stated a witness plane `q = (−3, 0, 5)` whose stated
  cross product `(4, 0, 3)` belongs to `q = (−3, 0, 9)`; the worker caught
  it (the fourth worker correction of the session, and the second one in a
  packet the orchestrator wrote). Ten seconds of Python on the cross
  product at packet-writing time would have caught it. The
  "re-derive every claim" rule applies to claims YOU wrote, not just ones
  you inherited.

- **`Start-Process` with `-RedirectStandardOutput` holds the calling shell
  until the tool's timeout, and the launched process survives the kill.**
  Every verify launch this session "timed out" at the tool cap while the
  verify ran to completion and wrote its verdict. The correct response is
  to poll the artifact (`VERDICT.json`, `verify.out`), never to re-launch —
  a second verify at the same base races the first on its baseline cache.

- **Composing enclosures: never forward an unbounded parameter box into an
  inner carrier's `enclose`.** The landed surface carriers' behavior on
  non-finite input boxes is not uniform — `bspline.rs`'s `hull_of` returns
  the EMPTY box for non-finite `tt` (its "non-finite → empty" rule reads
  NaN and ENTIRE the same way), so a composition that forwards
  `Interval::ENTIRE` inward can under-estimate the whole thing. Decide the
  out-of-range answer yourself, at the composition boundary (PCURVE's
  decision 4 encodes this; the landed `pcurve.rs` returns the unbounded
  box directly). If a future packet hits a similar asymmetry, the
  signature is a composition whose empty/unbounded cases disagree with the
  inner carrier's own.

- **PS 5.1 `Set-Content -Encoding UTF8` writes a BOM, and the watchdog's
  `packet_is_done` dies on it silently.** Session 15's incident: a registry
  edit made through PowerShell left `EF BB BF` at the head of
  `PACKETS.jsonl`; `read_text(encoding="utf-8")` then prefixes line 1 with
  U+FEFF, `json.loads` raises `ValueError`, and the `except` in
  `packet_is_done` returns `False` — so **every packet reads not-DONE and
  Rule B will redispatch a landed one.** At 01:53 it redispatched the
  already-merged `BG-ENC-004-PCURVE` onto the freshly forked
  `packet/BG-TOL-004` branch, where a worker dutifully re-verified the
  landed code and committed a RESULT-only commit. Zero lost work (the code
  was already in the tree), ~7 h of slot time and one worker run wasted.
  The artifact is archived at
  `loop/slots/0/misdispatched-pcurve-20260821-RESULT.json`. **Edit
  `PACKETS.jsonl` only through python** (the loop scripts or a `python -c`
  rewrite), and after any registry edit, run the watchdog's own read path
  and confirm a known-DONE id still reads `True`:
  `python -c "import json; rows={json.loads(l)['id']: json.loads(l)['status'] for l in open('loop/PACKETS.jsonl', encoding='utf-8') if l.strip()}; print(rows['BG-ENC-004-PCURVE'])"`
- **`new_slot.py` alone leaves the slot looking like a dead worker.** It
  resets the *worktree* but not `worker.pid` / `worker.packet` /
  `worker.branch` in the slot root, so a forked-but-not-yet-dispatched slot
  presents the previous packet's dead pid and stagnant events to the
  watchdog — which Rule-B's the *previous* packet onto the *new* branch
  (`run_packet.py` does not re-fork; that half is the older trap). The
  PCURVE misdispatch needed both halves of this: stale slot files AND the
  BOM-blinded DONE check — with the registry intact, `packet_is_done` would
  have held. **Fork and dispatch in one motion; if a forked slot must be
  left idle, delete its `worker.pid` / `worker.packet` / `worker.branch`
  first.**
- **Machine sleep reads as stagnation, and the watchdog reaps on wake.**
  The watchdog's clock is wall time; sleep freezes `events.jsonl` but not
  the clock, so a worker that slept 6.9 h (02:10–08:45, the heartbeat gap
  in `watchdog.log` is the signature) presents exactly like a wedged one
  and is killed and redispatched on the first poll after wake — CE-001
  attempt 1 died this way having done nothing wrong. The workers
  themselves survive sleep and resume fine. **If the machine will sleep
  (lid close, overnight), stop the watchdog first** (pid in
  `loop/watchdog.lock`) and restart it when the session resumes; restart
  budgets absorb one such reap, but each one wastes a worker's progress.

- **V8 reads a flaky proptest as a regression too — proven this session,
  and the recovery has a path trap.** BG-INV-102's first verify REJECTED
  on V8 via `truck-modeling/src/geom_impls.rs::test_circle_arc_tangent0`
  (a `#[property_test]`). The packet changed one unreferenced leaf module —
  impossible — and replaying the pinned seed at BASE proved it: the seed
  (p0/p1 both on the z-axis, `t = 0.9999789572401523`, so p2 ≈ p1 and
  `circum_center` is ill-conditioned) fails 4/4 at base too. The property
  is missing a precondition on `t` near 0/1 — a latent truck-modeling
  defect outside every write set. Recovery: delete the slot worktree's
  `proptest-regressions/` artifact and re-verify (fresh seeds pass 8/8).
  **THE PATH TRAP: the regression artifact is a DIRECTORY
  (`proptest-regressions/geom_impls.txt`), not a flat file — copying it to
  the flat path makes the replay run silently draw FRESH seeds and
  "pass", invalidating the experiment.** Reproduce at the right path
  before believing any pinned-seed result. Same disease family as the V5
  bspcurve flake; V8 inherits it. The property fix is future work in
  truck-modeling.

- **The RESULT.json landing dance has three flavors, and over-cleaning
  costs recoveries.** (a) Uncommitted: copy worktree → repo root BEFORE
  `land_packet.py` (it reads the root after the worktree check). (b)
  Committed: your untracked root copy BLOCKS the merge — remove it, land
  (the merge brings RESULT.json in tracked), then delete the root copy
  again. (c) If you delete the worktree copy too early: committed ones
  restore with `git -C <slot wt> checkout -- RESULT.json`; UNCOMMITTED
  ones are recoverable VERBATIM from the worker's session transcript —
  `events.jsonl` records the write tool call with the full content
  (`part.state.input.content`). **Never reconstruct a RESULT.json from
  memory or from a truncated read — the worker's reasoning must stay
  verbatim.** A land attempt that fails at the merge step has NOT filed
  anything; re-run it after fixing the collision.

- **API sketches validated OUTSIDE a crate do not type-check INSIDE it.**
  Session 16's INV packets were designed from scratch-crate perspective and
  all three wave-1 workers caught the same class: `Shell` takes THREE type
  parameters (`Shell<P, C, S>`, no default), `Shell` lives at the crate
  root (`use crate::Shell`, not `crate::shell::Shell` — shell.rs only
  privately glob-imports it), `use truck_topology::*` is E0432 from inside
  the crate (use `use crate::*`), and `#[derive(Default)]`-only types trip
  `missing_debug_implementations` in truck-topology but not in a scratch
  crate. The workers' `disagreements` field caught every one — packets that
  name API signatures must invite disagreement explicitly, and the
  orchestrator should write in-crate sketches as if from inside the module.

- **A checker that calls another crate's API needs the manifest edge — and
  nobody had landed it.** BG-INV-104 attempt 1 was a clean SPEC_GAP: the
  worker implemented the whole checker, hit E0432 on `use
  truck_evidence::…`, reverted to baseline and asked. The fix is
  `truck-topology → truck-evidence` (+ `inari`; `truck-geometry` as
  dev-dep) — acyclic, since evidence does not depend on topology — landed
  by the amended packet as decision 0 (manifest + lock in write_allow, the
  BG-CE-003 serde_json precedent). Spec amended: the edge is the intended
  layering. Any future invariants-tree checker speaking interval
  certificates uses the same edge.

- **`run_packet.py` dying with `PermissionError: [WinError 32]` on
  `events.jsonl` right after printing "Running packet" is BENIGN.** The
  worker launched and opened the events log before run_packet's own
  post-launch cleanup could reset it; the crash is orchestrator-side
  bookkeeping only. Check `slot_status.py` — a fresh pid and growing
  events means the dispatch took; do NOT re-run it.

- **`grep -rc PATTERN dir | wc -l` counts FILES, not matches** (GNU grep
  prints one line per file, zero-count files included) — two packet
  anchors were written with it this session and one was caught by
  `run_packet.py`'s own pre-dispatch anchor check (the A3 refusal, fixed
  before any worker was paid), the other by manual verification. The
  match-counting form is `grep -r PATTERN dir | wc -l`.

- **The scratch-crate pre-validation found three errors a compile check
  alone never would, and was worth every minute.** Session 16's CE-002
  scratch RUN (not just compiled) the whole design: it found the carriers'
  terminal-strip convergence defect (a BG-ENC-002 violation, spec
  amended), measured the bisection cost model that forced the two-route
  design (130 µs/cell → minutes per edge at tau=1e-6), and caught f64
  having neither Eq nor Hash. The discipline for design packets: compile
  it, then RUN the flagship witnesses and the cost, then write the packet
  with the measured numbers in it. The one thing the scratch could NOT
  cover was in-crate compilation (the trap above) — the workers covered
  that half, exactly as the disagreements field was designed for.

## The commands

`slot_status.py` prints each slot's branch and short HEAD (`git=branch@sha`),
flagged `(=base, no work)` when HEAD is still sitting at the slot's fork
point -- so which branch actually holds a packet's best attempt is read off
the slot, not reconstructed from prose the way BG-S0-002's attempt1 branch
had to be. `run_packet.py` records the branch it dispatched onto in
`loop/slots/<N>/worker.branch`, and `verify.py` records the branch and exact
commit it judged in `VERDICT.json`.

```
python loop/slot_status.py                     # what is every slot doing (poll this)
python loop/slot_status.py --kill-stalled       # reap anything silent for 12 min
python loop/new_slot.py  --slot N --branch packet/BG-XXX
python loop/run_packet.py --slot N --packet loop/packets/BG-XXX.md   # returns at once
python loop/verify.py    --slot N --packet loop/packets/BG-XXX.md [--base <ref>]
python loop/schedule.py --running BG-A,BG-B                          # the frontier
python loop/selftest_dispatch.py                # prove the dispatch works (~40s)
```

Dispatch is fire-and-forget by design: a worker runs for tens of minutes, and
anything that waits on it is a long-lived process that can be killed — when one
was, it took its worker down mid-run. Poll instead. Run `verify.py` with a long
timeout (or in the background); it takes about four minutes on a warm slot, more
with V5's `--no-fail-fast` running every test binary.

`verify.py` exits **0 ACCEPTED**, **1 REJECTED** (the work is wrong), **2
BLOCKED** (the run never finished — reset the worktree and redispatch;
nothing is implied about the worker's code), or **3 PARTIAL** (`--only` was
used — see below). Environment: Windows, `cargo`, and Git Bash at
`C:\Program Files\Git\bin\bash.exe`. The harness itself is Python 3
stdlib-only (`loop/*.py`).

`verify.py --slot N --packet ... --base <ref> --only V3,V5` runs just those
gates and reports the rest `SKIP`; V0 preflight always runs regardless,
since every other gate reads the diff between base and HEAD and that's
meaningless if the run didn't finish. This exists for the amend-and-verify
path: editing one test file to re-check V5 used to pay for a full 4-6 minute
cycle (V2, V3, V4, and the whole suite) even though nothing else changed. A
partial run can never report ACCEPTED — its verdict is always `PARTIAL`
(exit 3) no matter what the requested gates found, because acceptance is a
claim about the whole packet and nothing about re-checking one gate tells
you the others still hold.

## Quick reference — enough to write and judge a packet without another file

A packet is one markdown file whose YAML front block the verifier parses. Only
these fields are read mechanically; everything else in the file is prose aimed
at the worker.

```yaml
id:          BG-XX-000                     # contract item, one per packet
class:       mechanical | design | wide-mechanical
crates:      [truck-geometry, truck-base]  # cargo package names, not paths
write_allow:                               # repo-relative; V1 fails on anything else
  - vendor/truck/truck-geometry/src/specifieds/cone.rs
read_allow:  [...]                         # advisory; not enforced
tests_required:                            # V6 matches these against the diff
  - cone_apex_refuses
budget:      {turns: 40, ctx_tokens: 100000}
```

`RESULT.json` is the worker's terminal claim, e.g.
`{"id":"BG-S0-002","status":"DONE","contracts":[...],"tests_added":3,...}`.
The orchestrator may amend it after the fact -- see `loop/results/BG-S0-002.json`
for the real case: the worker returned `SPEC_GAP` correctly (one required test
was unreachable through anything in write_allow), the spec and packet were
sharpened to drop that test, and the orchestrator amended the worker's commit
rather than paying for a fresh ~90-minute dispatch. Any such amendment **must**
carry `"amended_by": "orchestrator"` and **must** keep the worker's original
reasoning verbatim under `notes` rather than overwrite it -- that reasoning is
often the only record of *why* a test or a behaviour is absent, and losing it
to a tidied-up summary destroys the one thing a future reader needs.
`verify.py` reads this field: when the worktree's `RESULT.json` carries
`amended_by`, it appears in the V0 preflight detail line and at the top level
of `VERDICT.json`, so a verdict can never silently present amended work as
untouched worker output.

The prose sections that make a packet work, in the order they earn their keep:
**Problem** (one paragraph, why this is reachable from untrusted geometry);
**Anchors** (a table of `rg` patterns with exact expected counts, verified the
day the packet is written — H-8); **decisions already made for you** (every
judgement you can pre-make, so the worker churns rather than designs);
**Template** (the nearest landed diff to copy — BG-S0-001's work in
`truck-modeling/src/geometry.rs` is the house pattern); **Tests required**;
**Done when** (the exact commands — run touched `--test <stem>` targets, not
`--lib --tests`, on this tree); **Forbidden**; **Stop conditions**
(`ANCHOR_MISMATCH`, `SPEC_GAP`, `BLOCKED`) and the `RESULT.json` shape.

The gates, in the order `verify.py` runs them:

| gate | asks |
|---|---|
| V0 preflight | did the run finish — commit past base, clean *tracked* tree, RESULT.json or QUESTION.md |
| V1 scope | is every changed file in `write_allow` |
| V2 build | `cargo check --locked -p <crates>` |
| V3 lint | `cargo fmt --check`, then clippy findings **on the added lines only** |
| V4 house rules | `scripts/kernel-gates.sh <base>` — H-1/H-3/H-4, diff-scoped |
| V5 tests | `cargo test -p <crates> --lib --tests --no-fail-fast`, FAIL only on **added** test fns |
| V6 test-reality | does every `tests_required` name appear as a real test fn in the diff |
| V7 mutation | stub — always passes |
| V8 no-regression | stub — always passes |

## The CE chain, scoped against the tree (session 9)

Seven of the nine BG-INV checkers gate on `BG-CE-003` through
`BG-CE-006-CYL-CONE -> BG-CE-006-ENUM -> BG-CE-001 -> BG-CE-003`. This is
what the tree says about the last two, as opposed to what the spec says.

- **`BG-CE-001` is mostly assembly and its design is already written.** The
  spec gives the struct verbatim — add `pcurve: Option<PC>` beside the
  existing per-use `orientation`, with `PC = ()` defaulting so `None`
  reproduces today's behaviour. truck's `Edge` is *already* a coedge. The
  work is a wide ripple: **25 files mention `Edge<` across six crates**
  (topology 8, shapeops 6, modeling 6, meshalgo 2, assembly 2, stepio 1).
  That write set is determinable now and getting it wrong is the single most
  common cause of a V1 rejection in this loop.
- **`BG-CE-002`'s certification is real math and is not assembly**:
  `‖Γ_f(pc_u(t)) − c_e(φ_u(t))‖ ≤ τ_e` for **all** t by interval evaluation
  over the whole span, gated on `BG-ENC-001`. Sampling is the classic false
  pass and the spec says so.
- **`BG-CE-003` is half-designed.** `EntityId` is spec'd as an enum, but
  **`Selector`, `OpId` and `Op` are defined nowhere in the tree** — checked —
  so `Sel { base, selector }` is a name, not a design. That algebra can be
  built and property-tested as a standalone module with no truck code
  involved, and that is where the design risk lives.
- **One spec correction, found by running its own command:** BG-CE-003's
  prose says "10 documented deadlock hazards" and its command says expect 12.
  **12 is right** — exactly 2 each in `edge.rs`, `face.rs`, `shell.rs`,
  `solid.rs`, `vertex.rs`, `wire.rs`. Fix the prose; a stale number in the
  item seven checkers gate on will be believed.

## Open questions

- **V9 was proven in session 7 — see "Pick up here" item 2** for both
  negative tests and what each one does and does not establish. It was added
  because nothing in this loop had ever been measured against real geometry.
  Its first version ran `tests/step.rs`, `torus_deck.rs` and
  `spline_carrier.rs`, **passed with `TOLERANCE` loosened 1e-6 → 1e-1**, and
  the reason is worth keeping: those tests assert *structure*, not geometry —
  one geometry, one instance, indices a multiple of 3, a colour present — and
  `torus_deck` asserts the torus's *declared* parameters read back from the
  source rather than anything tessellated. All of it holds for an arbitrarily
  wrong mesh. `tests/geometry_fingerprint.rs` is the fix (triangle count,
  vertex count, bounds) and passes clean, but has not been seen failing.
- **The corpus tooling is still unused.** `benchmarks/` and the face-census
  scripts have existed the whole time and the loop has never invoked them. V9
  covers two fixtures; that is "these two parts still tessellate the same
  way", not "the kernel is correct."
- V7 (mutation spot-check) and V8 (no-regression) are always-pass stubs. V7
  needs a packet field naming the negative test; V8 needs ledger state. V8 is
  the right home for "a packet broke a pre-existing test" -- V5 deliberately
  does not catch that, only added-test failures, so it never false-rejects on
  the baseline.
- V6 matches test names by keyword overlap, not exactly. Tighten when
  `gen_packet.py` fixes a naming convention.
- `gen_packet.py` exists and works end to end as of session 8. What it still
  does **not** do: `--skeleton` emits no prose, by design, and it has no notion
  of a site that needs a `FIXME` rather than a rewrite — `BG-TOL-001-MESHALGO`'s
  six deferred area sites had to be written by hand into a section the budget
  parser deliberately stops at. If a third shard needs deferrals, teach the
  survey schema an `action: fixme_marker` value and let the skeleton emit them.
- GATE-4's ceiling is checked, but nothing checks that a Stage-A shard's
  `// BG-TOL-001:` markers match its actual rewrites. The SHAPEOPS packet asks
  the worker to write that test itself (`every_migrated_shapeops_site_is_marked`).
  If that pattern holds up, hoist it into a gate rather than repeating it in
  six packets.
- BG-TOL-004 (what a squared-order tolerance means in a scale-relative system)
  is named in the spec but unwritten. 23 sites wait on it. It blocks nothing.
- BG-S0-002-r2 needs a constructed degenerate surface (a parametric pole where
  `uder` is parallel to `vder`) to exercise `create_pcurve_edge` directly. The
  fixture is design work; the orchestrator writes that packet.
- `opencode/deepseek-v4-flash-free` would run W4's 23 packets at no API cost.
  Untested against concurrent workers.
