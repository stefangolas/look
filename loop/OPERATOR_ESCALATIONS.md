## 2026-09-09 00:45 UTC - FH-TIMING-REFRESH landing blocked on a failing scoped check

- What: slot 0 FINISHED, packet FH-TIMING-REFRESH, wt HEAD 6c4ba7c (worker commit
  481ca91 "bench: Falcon-Heavy kernel timing column" + 6c4ba7c "file RESULT").
  RESULT.json status LANDED; row status READY; NOT yet merged into
  integration/kernel-bg.
- Why: the overnight driver's scoped check failed at 20:43 ("check -p
  truck-certified failed") and it left the landing for morning. FH-TIMING-REFRESH
  is a doc-production packet with `crates: [look]`; the driver's
  packet_tests_and_crates() falls back to `truck-certified` when the row writes no
  `vendor/truck/**` path - so the failing check may be the wrong crate (gate-wrong)
  OR disk-exhaustion (only ~5 GB free at the time). Either way a landing decision
  needs judgment I do not have.
- Start here: `git -C C:\Users\stefa\look log --oneline packet/FH-TIMING-REFRESH`;
  decide whether `cargo check -p truck-certified` at 6c4ba7c is meaningful for a
  docs-only packet; if the packet's own done-when (`cargo check -p look` +
  doc-production) passes, merge --no-ff and file `loop/results/FH-TIMING-REFRESH.json`.
  IMPORTANT: do NOT re-fork slot 0 until this lands or is closed - the unlanded
  RESULT.json in the worktree is the only copy.
